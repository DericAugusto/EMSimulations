# Electrical Machines Simulations  

This repository provides **Simulink simulations** for two types of **electrical machines**: **asynchronous machines** and **doubly-fed induction generators (DFIG)**.  

It includes the application of **vector control** to a **squirrel cage induction machine** for **speed regulation** when operating as a motor. This control method enables **precise speed adjustment** by independently controlling the torque and flux components.  

Additionally, the repository contains a **simulation of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)**, where the stator is directly connected to the power grid, while the rotor is controlled via power electronics. This approach allows for **power factor regulation** at the grid interface. The simulation, tested using **wind turbine parameters**, demonstrates how to adjust the **power factor** supplied by the DFIG to the power network.
