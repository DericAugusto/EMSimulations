# Electric Machines Simulations

This repository offers Simulink simulations for two types of electric machines: asynchronous machines and doubly-fed electric machines. It covers the application of vector control to a squirrel cage induction machine for speed control when used as a motor. This method allows for precise control over the motor's speed.

In addition, there's a simulation focusing on a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG), where the stator is connected to the power grid, and rotor control is used to manage the power factor output to the grid. This simulation, tested with the parameters of a wind generator, demonstrates how to control the power factor provided by the DFIG to the power network.
